# PyOptimization

The Python version 3 is used to implement the PyOptimization project, which uses the Python modules generated by the [PyOTL](https://github.com/O-T-L/PyOTL) project to carry out experiments. Various features are implemented in the PyOptimization, including full preservation of experimental results, batch experiments support, parallel and distributed computing, and data visualization.
